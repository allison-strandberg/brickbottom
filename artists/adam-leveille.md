The world is a crazy place.  I try to find something beautiful or interesting in all the messiness, and through the act of painting, share it with you, the viewer. 
Not all beauty is as obvious as a vase of flowers, or a scenic view.  It can be the stillness of an abandoned building, or the frenzied chaos of a strip mall. It can be sparkling colors on a crumpled up beer can, and it can be an old worn out tractor, finally at rest. 
 
Sometimes my painting speaks about memory or nostalgia.  Sometimes it comments on current events.  Often it is simply a record of a time and a place.
 
I hope you enjoy my work!
